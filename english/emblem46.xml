                <p>This transcription includes all text in the Beinecke library Mellon MS. 88 (English Translation of Michael Meier's Atalanta Fugiens).</p>
                <p>All line breaks are indicated using the <gi>lb</gi> element. Hyphenation is marked with the <att>break</att> attribute.
                    This manuscript has hyphens filling out lines at the right margin, as well as at the end of a page. These are marked as punctuation using
                     the <gi>pc</gi> element. Pagination as printed is encoded using <gi>fw</gi>. <gi>pb</gi> elements 
                     provide the page number in a canonical form. Page breaks in the original Meier printed text are also inserted and have been marked with a <gi>milestone</gi> element 
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone unit="page" ed="Meier" n="037"/></egXML></p>
                <p>Within the discourse section of each element, <gi>ab</gi> are used to group text that appears on each page of the equivalent Meier edition. This is useful when
                formatting a side-by-side edition, but can be ignored otherwise.</p>
                <p>Archaic spellings have been modernized throughout, using <gi>orig</gi>/<gi>reg</gi> pairs.</p>
                <p>Strikeouts and additions have been marked using <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements.</p>
                <p>This manuscript has underlining in a variety of hands. Underlining is indicated and an attempt has been made to 
                disambiguate hands. Underlining is marked using the <gi>seg</gi> element, for example, <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg rend="underline" hand="2"/></egXML></p>
               <p>In the Author's Epigram, text is marked with vertical bars along the left margin, this is marked as a note. In the Preface to the Reader, a long margin note is grouped using a long brace which is encoded
                    using a <att>rend</att> attribute on the note.</p>
                <p>Margin notes contain some alchemical symbols, which are itemized in the Character Declaration below.</p>
