                <p>This transcription includes all text in the Beinecke library Mellon MS. 48 (English Translation of Michael Meier's Atalanta Fugiens).</p>
                <p>All line breaks are indicated using the <gi>lb</gi> element. Hyphenation is marked with the <att>break</att> attribute.
                    This manuscript has hyphens filling out lines at the right margin, as well as at the end of a page. These are marked as punctuation using
                     the <gi>pc</gi> element. Pagination as printed is encoded using <gi>fw</gi>. <gi>pb</gi> elements 
                     provide the page number in a canonical form. Page breaks in the original Meier printed text are also inserted and have been marked with a <gi>milestone</gi> element 
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone unit="page" ed="Meier" n="037"/></egXML></p>
                <p>Within the discourse section of each element, <gi>ab</gi> are used to group text that appears on each page of the equivalent Meier edition. This is useful when
                formatting a side-by-side edition, but can be ignored otherwise.</p>
                <p>Archaic spellings have been modernized throughout, using <gi>orig</gi>/<gi>reg</gi> pairs.</p>
                <p>Strikeouts and additions have been marked using <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements.</p>
                <p>This manuscript has underlining in a variety of hands. Underlining is indicated and an attempt has been made to 
                disambiguate hands. Underlining is marked using the <gi>seg</gi> element, for example, <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg rend="underline" hand="2"/></egXML></p>
               <p>In the Author's Epigram, text is marked with vertical bars along the left margin, this is marked as a note. In the Preface to the Reader, a long margin note is grouped using a long brace which is encoded
                    using a <att>rend</att> attribute on the note.</p>
                <p>Margin notes contain some alchemical symbols, which are itemized in the Character Declaration below.</p>

                        <lb/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so</reg></choice>

                        <lb/>Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into <choice><orig>Phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophicall</orig><reg>Philosophical</reg></choice> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <lb/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <choice><orig>naturall</orig><reg>natural</reg></choice>, <choice><orig>unna
                        <lb break="no"/>turall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice>, fire against nature, and <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice>, which <choice><orig>kindleth</orig><reg>kindles</reg></choice> wood: These
                        <lb/>fires <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> use, and <choice><orig>noe</orig><reg>no</reg></choice> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><choice><orig>bodyes</orig><reg>bodies</reg></choice>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <lb/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <lb/>thing: Occasioned fire <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> call <choice><orig>unnaturall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <lb/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <choice><orig>glasse</orig><reg>glass</reg></choice>, which
                        <lb/>can <choice><orig>burne</orig><reg>burn</reg></choice> <choice><orig>bodyes</orig><reg>bodies</reg></choice> more effectually, than <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice> fire: these are their
                        <lb/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue, <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the <choice><orig>naturall</orig><reg>natural</reg></choice> in coagulating, the <choice><orig>unnaturall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice> in dissolving, the fire against
