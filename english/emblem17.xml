                        <lb/>The Philosophers have in many places made mention of four sorts of fire<milestone unit="section" n="e03-01" /> 
                        <lb/>necessary to the <choice><orig>naturall</orig><reg>natural</reg></choice> <choice><orig>worke</orig><reg>work</reg></choice>, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley,
                        <lb/>and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (<choice><orig>Sayth</orig><reg>Says</reg></choice> Scala).
                        <lb/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so</reg></choice>
                        <lb/><choice><orig>contrarywise</orig><reg>contrariwise</reg></choice> the fire of nature <choice><orig>congeales</orig><reg>congeals</reg></choice> the dissolved spirit of a fixed
                        <lb/>body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into <choice><orig>Phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophicall</orig><reg>Philosophical</reg></choice> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <lb/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <choice><orig>naturall</orig><reg>natural</reg></choice>, <choice><orig>unna
                        <lb break="no"/>turall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice>, fire against nature, and <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice>, which <choice><orig>kindleth</orig><reg>kindles</reg></choice> wood: These
                        <lb/>fires <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> use, and <choice><orig>noe</orig><reg>no</reg></choice> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><choice><orig>bodyes</orig><reg>bodies</reg></choice>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <lb/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <lb/>thing: Occasioned fire <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> call <choice><orig>unnaturall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <lb/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <choice><orig>glasse</orig><reg>glass</reg></choice>, which
                        <lb/>can <choice><orig>burne</orig><reg>burn</reg></choice> <choice><orig>bodyes</orig><reg>bodies</reg></choice> more effectually, than <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice> fire: these are their
                        <lb/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue, <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the <choice><orig>naturall</orig><reg>natural</reg></choice> in coagulating, the <choice><orig>unnaturall</orig><reg>unnatural</reg></choice> in dissolving, the fire against
                        <lb/>nature in corrupting, the <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice> in <choice><orig>administring</orig><reg>administering</reg></choice> the first heat and
                        <lb/>motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Se
                        <lb break="no"/>cond may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by
                        <lb/>the third and first together to action, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so</reg></choice> as that one is the agent, and
                        <lb/>the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                        <lb/>respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
                        <lb/>Magnet, and <choice><orig>joyned</orig><reg>joined</reg></choice> by <choice><orig>mutuall</orig><reg>mutual</reg></choice> contact, the same in these fires: for the
                        <lb/><choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice> <choice><orig>doth</orig><reg>does</reg></choice> like the Magnet <choice><orig>immit</orig><reg>emit</reg></choice> its virtue though the second
                        <lb/>and third even to the fourth, and <choice><orig>joynes</orig><reg>joins</reg></choice> one to another by <choice><orig>mutuall</orig><reg>mutual</reg></choice> <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>operations, and <choice><orig>causeth</orig><reg>causes</reg></choice> them to <choice><orig>sticke</orig><reg>stick</reg></choice> together, till <choice><orig>internall</orig><reg>internal</reg></choice> action be
                        <lb/>effected amongst the uppermost: The first is <choice><orig>elementall</orig><reg>elemental</reg></choice> fire indeed <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and name, the second is <choice><orig>aire</orig><reg>air</reg></choice> or airy, the third <choice><orig>watry</orig><reg>watery</reg></choice> or of a Lunar na
                        <lb break="no"/>ture, the fourth earthy: It is <choice><orig>needlesse</orig><reg>needless</reg></choice> to say any thing of the first, <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>because it is <choice><orig>knowne</orig><reg>known</reg></choice> to every mans eye and touch: The three other are
                        <lb/>dragons, menstrua's, waters, Sulphurs, and <choice><orig>Mercuryes</orig><reg>Mercuries</reg></choice>: Dragons, because <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>being participants of venenosity, they <choice><orig>devoure</orig><reg>devour</reg></choice> serpents of their <choice><orig>owne</orig><reg>own</reg></choice>

                        <lb/>and mixed with them: They are called Menstrua's, because the <choice><orig>Philoso
                        <lb break="no"/>phicall</orig><reg>Philosophical</reg></choice> infant is produced from them, and nourished therewith even to
                        <lb/>its nativity: Lully in his <choice><orig>booke</orig><reg>book</reg></choice> of the Quintessence, dist. 3. <choice><orig>hath</orig><reg>has</reg></choice> two <pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>Menstruums, the vegetable, and <choice><orig>minerall</orig><reg>mineral</reg></choice>, Ripley in his <choice><orig>Præface</orig><reg>Preface</reg></choice> of the gates <choice><orig>hath</orig><reg>has</reg></choice>
                        <lb/>three, which are really one and <choice><orig>doe</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> agree: for the generation of the infant
                        <lb/>is made of them <choice><orig>alltogether</orig><reg>altogether</reg></choice>, and a white water <choice><orig>præceeds</orig><reg>preceeds</reg></choice> the birth of it, which
                        <lb/>is not of the substance but superfluity of the infant, and therefore to be <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>separated: They are waters, because in fire they <choice><orig>Shew</orig><reg>Show</reg></choice> a <choice><orig>watry</orig><reg>watery</reg></choice> nature, that
                        <lb/>is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><choice><orig>propertyes</orig><reg>properties</reg></choice> of waters are different and <choice><orig>wonderfull</orig><reg>wonderful</reg></choice>, whereof some <choice><orig>doe</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> <choice><orig>petrefy</orig><reg>petrify</reg></choice>, be

                        <lb/>Philosophers <choice><orig>minerall</orig><reg>mineral</reg></choice> waters, which <choice><orig>doe</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> condense, and <choice><orig>turne</orig><reg>turn</reg></choice> into a stony con
                        <lb break="no"/>sistence: They are <choice><orig>allso</orig><reg>also</reg></choice> called Sulphurs because of the virtue of Sulphur, <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one,
                        <lb/>and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are <choice><orig>præserved</orig><reg>preserved</reg></choice> and contained
                        <lb/>by Sulphurs, as Yximidius in Turba <choice><orig>sayth</orig><reg>says</reg></choice>: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris
                        <lb/>there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the <choice><orig>fower</orig><reg>four</reg></choice> elements,
                        <lb/>which being extracted by art <choice><orig>doe</orig><reg>do</reg></choice> naturally <choice><orig>containe</orig><reg>contain</reg></choice> one another and are <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><choice><orig>joyned</orig><reg>joined</reg></choice> together: if you can by water <choice><orig>governe</orig><reg>govern</reg></choice> and purify well that which <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>is hidden in the belly of Sulphur, that hidden thing meeting with its <choice><orig>owne</orig><reg>own</reg></choice> <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>nature <choice><orig>rejoyceth</orig><reg>rejoices</reg></choice>, even as water with its like. I will now tell you (<choice><orig>Sayth</orig><reg>Says</reg></choice> Mosius
                        <lb/><choice><orig>allso</orig><reg>also</reg></choice>) what it is: the first <choice><orig>indeed</orig><reg>in deed</reg></choice>, which is fiery Argent vive, the second, the <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>body compounded in it, and the third is the water of Sulphur, by which the

                        <lb/>That which is <choice><orig>sayd</orig><reg>said</reg></choice> of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so</reg></choice> <pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>many <choice><orig>Mercuryes</orig><reg>Mercuries</reg></choice>: For this <choice><orig>sayth</orig><reg>says</reg></choice> the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive
                        <lb/>Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur
                        <lb/>which ascends from a <choice><orig>mixd</orig><reg>mixed</reg></choice> compound: But I will <choice><orig>omitt</orig><reg>omit</reg></choice> the inference of
