                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire 
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a

Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <span class="original">naturall </span><span class="regularized">natural</span>, <span class="original">unna<span class="original">=<br/></span>turall </span><span class="regularized">unnatural</span>, fire against nature, and <span class="original">elementall </span><span class="regularized">elemental</span>, which <span class="original">kindleth </span><span class="regularized">kindles</span> wood: These
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>fires <span class="original">wee </span><span class="regularized">we</span> use, and <span class="original">noe </span><span class="regularized">no</span> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate 
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/><span class="original">bodyes </span><span class="regularized">bodies</span>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>thing: Occasioned fire <span class="original">wee </span><span class="regularized">we</span> call <span class="original">unnaturall </span><span class="regularized">unnatural</span>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where<span class="original">=<br/></span>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned 
                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <span class="original">glasse </span><span class="regularized">glass</span>, which

                        <span class="original"><br/></span><span class="regularized"/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue,
